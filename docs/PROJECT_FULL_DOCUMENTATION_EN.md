# Full Project Documentation: Hebrew AI Platform

## 1. Project Purpose
Hebrew AI Platform is a web platform for learning and practicing Hebrew with an administrative panel, role and permission management (RBAC), action auditing, telemetry, and a separate AI task orchestration layer (`core`).

The project is divided into 4 independent layers:
- `frontend-react` — client application (React + TypeScript + Vite).
- `backend` — API and business logic (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Redis).
- `core` — Python orchestrator for multi-agent workflows.
- `infra` + `docker-compose.yml` — container infrastructure, routing, and observability.

## 2. Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Router, Bootstrap, Lucide Icons.
- Backend: Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, bcrypt, helmet, cors, rate limiting.
- AI Bridge: Python 3, pytest, custom protocols and agent routing.
- Infra: Docker/Podman, Traefik, Nginx, Loki, Promtail, Grafana.

## 3. Repository Structure
- `backend/` — server, API routes, middleware, RBAC, DB migrations.
- `frontend-react/` — pages, auth/language/theme contexts, admin panel.
- `core/` — task orchestrator, agents, model selector, tests, schemas.
- `infra/` — Loki/Promtail/Grafana configs and edge configs.
- `scripts/` — startup, deployment, bridge integration, and environment automation.
- `docs/` — architecture and operations documentation.

## 4. Architecture and Flows
### 4.1 User flow
1. A user signs up/logs in on the frontend.
2. The backend validates data, creates a session, and sets access/refresh cookies.
3. The frontend works through the API client with role/permission checks.

### 4.2 Administrative flow
1. Access to `/api/admin/*` is allowed only after `verifyToken` + `adminApiLimiter` + `requireRole(['root','platform_admin'])`.
2. All admin operations are validated by RBAC checks (`requirePermission`).
3. Role/permission/user changes are logged to audit and technical logs.

### 4.3 AI flow
1. A root task is decomposed into atomic tasks (`plan/code/test/review`).
2. `ModelSelector` chooses a model/provider and complexity level.
3. `TaskRouter` and `SmartScheduler` route each task to an agent.
4. `FeedbackLoop` and `QualityAnalyzer` verify quality and create fix tasks when needed.
5. `ResultMerger` builds final output and metrics.

## 5. Backend: Implemented Features and Behavior
### 5.1 Entry point
File: `backend/server.ts`
- Uses `helmet`, `cookie-parser`, `compression`, and a global API limiter.
- CORS is configured with origin normalization and wildcard patterns.
- Telemetry and audit middleware are enabled.
- DB migrations and email blocklist auto-update are initialized on startup.
- Routes: `/api/auth`, `/api/users`, `/api/access`, `/api/admin`, `/api/publications`, `/api/profile-avatar`, etc.
- Health endpoint: `/api/health`.

### 5.2 Authentication and sessions
File: `backend/api/routes/auth.ts`
- Registration with email/username normalization.
- Password validation with security rules.
- Disposable email checks plus domain blocklist/allowlist policy.
- Safe username suggestion generation on collisions.
- JWT access/refresh tokens, refresh token hash stored in `user_sessions`.
- Secure comparison via `timingSafeEqual` for critical values.

### 5.3 RBAC and access management
Key files:
- `backend/api/security/rbacCatalog.ts`
- `backend/api/security/rbacService.ts`
- `backend/api/routes/accessControl.ts`
- `backend/api/middleware/authorization.ts`

Implementation:
- Role/permission catalog and hierarchy.
- CRUD for custom roles.
- Role assignment/revocation for users.
- User block/unblock controls.
- Access profile caching with invalidation on updates.

### 5.4 Admin surface
File: `backend/api/routes/admin.ts`
- Strict access hardening for admin API.
- Response cache disabled (`Cache-Control: no-store`).
- Submodules: users, access, publications, metrics, audit, technical logs.

### 5.5 Logging, audit, and security
- `backend/api/middleware/auditTrail.ts` — audit context and critical action logging.
- `backend/api/middleware/telemetry.ts` — request/context telemetry.
- `backend/api/middleware/security.ts` — limiters and abuse protection.
- `backend/api/middleware/errorHandler.ts` — centralized error handling.

### 5.6 Database and migrations
Directory: `backend/database/migrations/`
- `001_init.sql` — base schema.
- `002_user_sessions.sql` — session tables and refresh-token flow.
- `003_users_security_and_search.sql` — user security + search indexes.
- `004_item_metadata_telemetry_and_quiz_attempts.sql` — content and telemetry.
- `005_rbac_roles_permissions.sql` — roles/permissions.
- `006_rbac_strict_admin_hardening.sql` — admin hardening.
- `007_admin_search_indexes.sql` — admin search indexing.
- `008_user_self_service_permissions.sql` — self-service permissions.
- `009_audit_events.sql` — audit events.
- `010_user_telemetry_enhanced_context.sql` — extended telemetry.
- `011_user_ui_preferences.sql` — user UI preferences.

## 6. Frontend: Implemented Features and Behavior
### 6.1 Core logic
- Entry point: `frontend-react/src/main.tsx`.
- Auth/theme/language state via contexts:
  - `context/AuthContext.tsx`
  - `context/ThemeContext.tsx`
  - `context/LanguageContext.tsx`
- API layer:
  - `src/api/client.ts` — base HTTP client.
  - `src/api/admin*.ts`, `src/api/access.ts`, `src/api/publications.ts`.

### 6.2 User interface
- `src/App.tsx` — main dashboard, navigation, status cards, activity blocks.
- `src/components/Layout/*` — sidebar, header, UI preference controls.
- `src/pages/*` — public and user-facing pages.

### 6.3 Admin panel
File: `src/components/Admin/AdminPanel.tsx`
- Main functional sections:
  - Overview/Health
  - User Directory/Create User
  - Groups Catalog/Assignments
  - Publications Moderation
  - Audit Trail/API Logs
- Includes filtering, sorting, CRUD operations, and permission controls.
- Sensitive actions require explicit RBAC checks (`hasPermission`, `canEditUserPermissions`).

## 7. AI Bridge: Implemented Features and Behavior
### 7.1 Core
File: `core/core/orchestrator.py`
- Full pipeline wiring: registry, lifecycle, autoscaler, scheduler, router, healthcheck, feedback, KPI, quality, merger.
- `run_task`: model selection, routing, agent execution, quality analysis, auto-fix via feedback loop.
- `run`: DAG execution with dependency handling.

### 7.2 Routing and model selection
- `core/task_router.py` — selects agents by capability.
- `core/model_selector.py` — selects the route by task complexity and risk.
- `core/openai_model_registry.py` — fetches and caches the live OpenAI model list when auto-routing is enabled.
- `core/openai_runtime_router.py` — builds the per-task OpenAI model plan and respects the session token budget.
- `core/provider_budget_router.py` — keeps the task on cheaper Mistral/Gemini/local paths when OpenAI is absent or not worth the cost.
- `core/smart_scheduler.py` — decides P2P vs orchestrator route.

The current runtime does not rely on one fixed OpenAI model name. It prefers
the live account model list, then falls back to the configured provider chain
when OpenAI is not available.

### 7.3 Execution protocol
(commit 2026-05-23)
- `core/message_bus.py` — envelope/transport message model.
- `core/models.py` — task/result/status types.
- `core/result_merger.py` — merges outputs from multiple results.
- `tests/test_protocol.py`, `test_message_bus_envelope.py`, `test_reassemble.py` — framing and reassembly validation.

## 8. Infrastructure and Deployment
### 8.1 Containers
File: `docker-compose.yml`
Services:
- `traefik` — edge/router.
- `postgres`, `redis` — data services.
- `backend`, `frontend` — application services.

### 8.2 Hardening and improvements
- Health checks for backend/frontend/infra services.
- Log rotation (`json-file`, max-size/max-file).
- Service labels for centralized Loki log routing.
- Podman/Docker socket-path support via environment variables.
